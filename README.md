# Face Recognition in MATLAB
By Jeffrey Lee & Oriol Resina

A MATLAB-based face recognition program submitted as a challenge entry at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. The main program files exist in the Challenge Files directory, and programs to process facial images and analyze results exist in the Utilities directory. Our recognition program was first trained on a set of 1260 images, and then tested with an entirely different set of 1200 images. Facial detection was done using a Cascade Object Detector, and identifiable HOG features were then extracted from the faces and tested against our Support Vector Machine models.
